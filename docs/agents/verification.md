# Verification gates

Local verification has three moments: commits get a fast conservative signal,
landing candidates receive substantive correctness review, and pushes prove
that exact approved history before running the comprehensive automated suite.
Review happens once, before landing on local `main`; publication reuses that
evidence instead of reviewing an expanding stack again.

## Gate ownership

| Moment | Gate | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| During development | `npx vitest run path/to/test.ts` | Keep the red-green-refactor loop focused. |
| Before each commit | `npm run lint` and `npm run test:staged` | Run colocated tests for staged code plus explicitly mapped high-risk invariants. |
| Before landing | `npm run review:candidate -- <base> <tip> [--test-design <json>]` | Review one explicit candidate range and record an immutable approval for a valid pass. |
| Before each push | `npm run review:push`, `npm run test:full`, and `npm run test:e2e` | Require exact approval coverage for every outgoing ref, run every Vitest file once, then exercise the browser smoke flow. |

### Candidate review and landing

The shared checkout stays clean on local `main`; every substantive slice is
implemented and committed in a worktree. Independent candidates may be built
concurrently, but final review and landing form a serialized admission queue:

1. Rebase the next independent candidate onto the latest reviewed local `main`.
2. Run its focused verification and commit the final candidate tip.
3. Run `npm run review:candidate -- <main-sha> <candidate-tip>`.
4. If the candidate passes, land it immediately with `git merge --ff-only`.
5. Remove the landed worktree and branch.

Do not review several sibling candidates from the same base. After one lands,
the others must rebase before review. Dependent candidates remain deliberately
stacked until their reviewed base lands.

`review:candidate` resolves the supplied base and tip to commits, requires the
base to be an ancestor, and rejects merge commits so the reviewed candidate
history remains linear. The review packet sends the exact commit list and
per-commit patch series to Fable Medium. It also requests first-parent merge
diffs defensively, preserving empty commits, conflict-resolution changes, and
add-then-revert histories that an endpoint-tree diff would hide. If Fable
cannot return a valid structured decision because of quota,
timeout, process, or malformed output, GPT-5.6 High receives the same immutable
input. A valid failure from either reviewer is blocking and never creates an
approval. A pass is valid only with zero findings; contradictory structured
output is malformed and remains fail-closed.

A pass writes a receipt below the repository's common Git directory:

```text
.git/pxlblz/review-approvals/v1/
```

Worktrees share this directory. Receipts are deliberately outside source
control and contain the exact base and tip identities, reviewer and effort,
prompt and output-schema versions, review-policy fingerprint, optional
test-design-context digest, decision, and timestamp. Receipt files are created
without overwrite permission. Amend, rebase, squash, cherry-pick, changed tip,
changed policy, malformed receipt, missing receipt, or a gap between receipts
invalidates reuse.

Use `npm run review:status -- <base> <tip>` to inspect whether a range is
approved, missing, or stale and to display the contiguous receipt chain.

### Systematic test-design context

When `systematic-test-design` produced a candidate model, pass a JSON file with
the review:

```json
{
  "invariants": ["Accepted history remains byte-identical through landing."],
  "partitions": ["single receipt", "contiguous chain", "missing approval"],
  "sequences": ["review A-B, review B-C, then push A-C"],
  "oracles": ["the outgoing range is covered exactly from remote SHA to tip"],
  "residualGaps": ["remote main can advance before publication"]
}
```

The command validates all five arrays, includes them in the review packet, and
records their digest in the receipt. A review-discovered defect family returns
through `systematic-test-design` for a same-class sweep before the replacement
candidate is reviewed.

### Publication

The Husky `pre-push` hook reads Git's exact ref-update packet. Deleted refs and
unchanged commit identities require no approval; different commit identities
remain reviewable even when their endpoint trees match. Each changed existing
or new ref must have one current approval or a contiguous current chain from
its remote base to its pushed tip. A new ref derives its base only from the
remote main line; if that baseline does not exist, the gate blocks instead of
self-basing the range at the pushed tip. Missing or stale coverage blocks with an explicit
`review:candidate` command; pre-push does not repeat substantive review.

After every outgoing ref has exact coverage, the hook runs the full Vitest suite
and Playwright smoke suite once. Because this is a Git hook rather than a Claude
or Codex lifecycle hook, it applies equally to agent and terminal pushes.

`npm test` remains the explicit full-suite command. The pre-push hook invokes the
same full suite, so a separate full run immediately before pushing normally adds
delay without adding coverage.

Candidate review transmits the exact private diff and supplied engineering
context to Anthropic under the developer's authenticated Claude session. A
fallback transmits the same material to OpenAI under the authenticated Codex
session. The user has explicitly approved both behaviors for this repository.

## Show authoring edit contracts

Pure Show composition edits use
`src/test/showAuthoringContract.ts` as their common test boundary. An accepted
edit must leave both its Show and composition deeply unchanged, return a
distinct composition, pass `validateShowComposition`, and supply
operation-specific unified-timeline projection and durable-reference
assertions. A refused edit must return the original composition by reference
and leave both inputs deeply unchanged.

Move and resize tests in `src/engine/showTimelineClipAuthoring.test.ts` provide
the initial single-Scene, cross-Scene, accepted, refused, and edit-sequence
examples. The declared cross-operation partitions, review-defect map, and
multi-step cases live in
[`logical-clip-test-matrix.md`](logical-clip-test-matrix.md). Extend the same
harness as more Show authoring operations adopt this contract. Keep projection
assertions focused on visible logical Clips and use the reference callback for
Pattern instances, property tracks, Transitions, logical Clip identity, Groups,
or Layer ownership relevant to the operation.

During development, run:

```bash
npx vitest run src/test/showAuthoringContract.test.ts \
  src/engine/showAuthoringMatrix.test.ts \
  src/engine/showTimelineClipAuthoring.test.ts \
  src/engine/showCompositionModel.test.ts \
  src/engine/showClipInspectorModel.test.ts \
  src/engine/showLayerTransitionAuthoring.test.ts \
  src/store/showStore.test.ts
```

The staged-test selector treats the shared helper as an invariant boundary.
Changing it runs its fault-sensitivity characterization suite, the central
matrix, the operation-specific Show-authoring suites, and the persistence
sequence.

## Show authoring mutation qualification

`npm run test:mutation:show-authoring` checks whether the Show authoring suite
rejects a small catalog of plausible faults. It is intentionally narrower than
whole-file mutation: the command resolves named source fragments through the
TypeScript syntax tree, runs the five owning Vitest suites in an isolated Node
project, and writes `reports/mutation/show-authoring.json`.

The catalog spans every critical operation family without turning mutation
testing into a second full suite:

| Operation | Qualified fault boundary |
| --- | --- |
| Move | Dispatch between ordinary and multi-Scene logical Clip movement |
| Resize | Placement-animation keyframes retain their offset from the moved edge |
| Split | The public plan uses strict interior Clip boundaries |
| Duplicate | The duplicate starts at the source Clip's exact end |
| Delete | The complete logical Clip, its tracks, and connected Transitions are removed together |
| Inspector | Timing and colocated placement fields commit or refuse atomically |
| Transition | Insert validation and resize-delta arithmetic preserve a valid composition |

The wrapper fails closed when the runner cannot start, omits or malforms its
JSON report, reports no mutants, leaves a result pending, times out or errors,
or leaves a meaningful survivor unexplained. Equivalent or mechanically
irrelevant survivors belong in
`scripts/show-authoring-mutation-classifications.json` with a stable
fingerprint and concrete reason. The parser rejects blank, duplicate, and stale
classifications. The qualified #597 run on 2026-07-23 killed all 57 selected
mutants in 6.4 seconds, with no survivors, timeouts, errors, or classifications.

Run this command after changing one of the catalogued transformation boundaries,
after a review cluster exposes weak fault sensitivity in the Show authoring
family, or before handing off a systemic Show-test change. Keep it outside the
pre-commit and pre-push hooks; the ordinary focused and full suites remain the
routine gates.

## Staged-test selection

`scripts/test-staged.mjs` reads added, copied, modified, and renamed paths from
the Git index. When those paths can affect either configured TypeScript project,
it first runs `tsc -b --pretty false`; a type-invalid source or test change
therefore cannot be committed even when ESLint and Vitest accept the file. It
then selects a staged test directly or the colocated test for a staged
JavaScript or TypeScript source file. `scripts/test-selection.mjs` also adds
fixed regression suites when a changed path touches a boundary where a
colocated test is not a sufficient safety net:

- Show compiler and generated controller artifacts
- personal-content persistence, APIs, and database migrations
- controller resource accounting
- Pattern artifact production and stamping
- Vitest configuration and staged-test infrastructure
- shared Show authoring edit contracts

Documentation-only commits skip Vitest at pre-commit. The full review-and-test
pre-push gate is unchanged by the selection result and remains the final
authority.
