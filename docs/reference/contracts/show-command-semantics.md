# Show command semantics

The Show command registry defines edits for callers of `applyShowCommand` and
`runShowCommandTransaction`. A command returns a candidate Show or a typed
refusal; the caller owns adoption, history, and persistence. This agreement
covers the registry, not every direct engine mutation or editor gesture.

## Agreement

- Commands preserve their input record on acceptance and refusal. Callers use
  the returned record rather than expecting an in-place edit.
- Registry names and each descriptor's fields define the invocation interface.
  Unknown commands and missing, mistyped, or unknown arguments produce typed
  issues. Domain refusal carries a reason; optional remedies and candidates
  help the caller recover. Descriptor schemas own invocation shape; the
  [generated coverage report](../show-command-coverage.md) owns the inventory.
- An unchanged engine identity result is a typed refusal, not success. Some
  commands also explicitly refuse no change, such as renaming to the current
  name. Such a step aborts its containing batch; replay is not guaranteed to
  succeed merely because the desired state already exists.
- Clip, marker, and transition ids identify existing targets. Moving or resizing a Clip retains its
  identity; creation and removal follow their command's semantics. Names,
  selection, and timeline positions do not replace those ids. Overlay layers
  are addressed by index; each descriptor defines the target convention.
- A transaction evaluates commands in order against successive candidate
  records. The first refusal returns its zero-based step and issues, without
  returning a partially accepted record. Earlier successful steps do not
  mutate the caller's original record.
- A successful transaction returns one candidate and its accumulated changes.
  Persisting that candidate once is the caller's responsibility and is what
  gives the batch one editor history entry. Evaluation itself writes no store
  or durable state. An empty transaction returns the original record.

## Limits callers must preserve

The registry validates invocation shape and delegates domain acceptance to the
command. It does not establish a universal final-document validation pass or
hardware delivery readiness. Each command still applies its own preconditions
inside a transaction; a batch cannot assume every temporarily invalid
intermediate state is permitted.

The descriptor's `touches` paths describe possible writes. They are not a read
set or a proof that two commands commute. This interface supplies no document
revision comparison, concurrent merge, cancellation, or persistence guarantee.
See [Show state, history, and persistence](show-state-history-persistence.md)
for adoption and save behavior.

## Ownership and evidence

[Registry types and evaluation](../../../src/engine/showCommands/registry.ts)
own this interface; the imported command families own operation semantics.
[Registry tests](../../../src/engine/showCommands/registry.test.ts) exercise
input validation, representative immutable edits and refusals, ordered batches,
and failure without partial mutation.
[Command tests](../../../src/engine/showCommands/commands.test.ts) exercise
individual outcomes, including retained Clip target ids for move and resize.
These are executable examples, not exhaustive proof over every possible Show.
